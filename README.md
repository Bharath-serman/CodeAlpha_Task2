## Music Generation with AI

###  Project Workflow

1. **Collect MIDI music data**
   - Gather MIDI files of different genres such as classical, jazz, etc., to serve as the training dataset.

2. **Preprocess the data**
   - Convert MIDI files into note sequences.
   - Tools used: [`music21`](https://web.mit.edu/music21/)
   - Output: Sequence of musical notes ready for input into the neural network.

3. **Build a deep learning model**
   - Use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTM or even GANs to understand and learn music patterns.
   - Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch

4. **Train the model**
   - Train the AI model on the preprocessed note sequences.
   - Goal: Generate new, original sequences of music that follow learned patterns.

5. **Convert generated sequences to MIDI**
   - Convert the predicted notes back into a MIDI file format.
   - Play or export the generated music.

## Sample Output

Generated music can be found in the `output/` folder after training. You can listen to the MIDI files using any audio/MIDI player or digital audio workstation (DAW).
